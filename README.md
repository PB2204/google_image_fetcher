# google_image_fetcher

Google Image Fetcher is a Python library that allows you to fetch images from Google Search using the Custom Search JSON API.

## Motive Of The Project

Frontend Developers faces a problem , when they develop any website , that is IMAGE . All the time , they have to go to Google , to search and download the images , they want to use this in their website , when there is no Graphic Designer available in their team . As a Frontend Developer , I also faces the same problem . To solve this problem here you have this Python Library .

I want to develop this library for non-python programmers also . Here You can use this library , without any knowledge of Python Programming .

Here after following all the steps , you will be able to use the images , which will be downloaded according to your prompt / query . Also you can see the `URL` of those images in the terminal below .

)
```

## Installation

You can install this library using pip:

```bash
pip install google_image_fetcher
```

or

```bash
pip install google-image-fetcher
```

Then You've to create new python `(.py)` file in the same folder , you're working in the Frontend / Full-Stack project .

Then You've to copy the following lines of code to your `.py` file .

```bash
from google_image_fetcher.google_image_fetcher import GoogleImageFetcher

# Create a GoogleImageFetcher instance
fetcher = GoogleImageFetcher()

# Define the search query
query = "YOUR_QUERY"

# Fetch and save images
fetcher.fetch_images(query, save_folder="YOUR_FOLDER NAME")
```

You just need to substitute `YOUR_QUERY` to your required `Image Name` and the `YOUR_FOLDER NAME` to , where you want to download the images , which will be created inside the same folder, where you're currently working . This is so simple to use .

Now you're ready to use the images .
